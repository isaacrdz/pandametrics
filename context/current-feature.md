- **Init Project** (2026-10-13): cleaned the Create Next App boilerplate (index only shows an `h1` with "Panda Metrics"), moved `app/` to `src/app/` with `@/*` → `./src/*`, light theme by default with a `.dark` class, Geist font applied, removed boilerplate SVGs, new README, ignored `.claude/settings.local.json`, and connected `origin` to `git@github.com:Ellyonsoft/panda-metrics.git`
- **Dashboard View** (2026-10-13): shadcn/ui (Nova, Radix, Lucide) with Panda Metrics theme tokens, `next-themes` (light default) and sonner; app shell with collapsible sidebar (Dashboard, Encuestas, Historial, Configuración) and top bar; `/` redirects to `/dashboard`; stat cards (Respuestas totales, Encuestas activas, Respuestas hoy), search and date range in the URL inside `Suspense`, skeletons and empty states; survey cards with question carousel and Satisfaction / Rating / Poll charts, icon buttons to copy link, copy code and edit; data from `src/lib/mock-data.ts` through `src/lib/dashboard.ts`
- **Internationalization** (2026-10-13): next-intl without URL routing; language in `localStorage` (`panda-metrics:locale`, English default, Spanish) read by a client `LocaleProvider`, inline head script that hides the page until a non-default language is applied, remount on the first locale divergence to avoid hydration mismatches in streamed Suspense boundaries; server renders English, translated text in Client Components; all copy in `src/messages/{en,es}.json` with ICU plurals, formatting through `useFormatter` (`en-US` / `es-MX`); `LanguageSwitcher` with SVG flags in the top bar; `react/jsx-no-literals` and message key parity check in `yarn lint`
- **Survey Form** (2026-10-13): `/surveys/new` and `/surveys/[id]` share one `SurveyForm` (only `FORM_MODES` knows create vs. edit); Zod 4 schema with per-category rules and message-key errors; category picker locked when the survey has responses; per-category editors (unique reactions with label and color, generated rating stars, 2–5 poll options) with counters and limits; Server Actions returning error codes; in-memory survey store (`src/lib/surveys/service.ts`) with the future Prisma API (merge by id, archiving by omission, 5-active limit, soft delete) read by the dashboard; share panel (SVG QR, PNG download, link and code copy, created at / by), delete with confirmation, unsaved changes dialog and `beforeunload`, 500px and dark mode checked
